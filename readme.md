# AB 5 - Does Race and Gender affect voting ? 

Our study delved into the 2020 US election, focusing on the intricate relationship between demographics and voting patterns. We discovered that despite a record turnout, substantial numbers of eligible voters in counties such as Los Angeles, Cook, and Harris did not cast a ballot, hinting at underlying systemic issues. Notably, our analysis revealed that racial minorities are underrepresented among voters, and women are emerging as a decisive force in the electoral process.

The data, drawn from the American Community Survey and the 2020 Presidential Election results, allowed us to identify demographic voting trends and the most significant non-voter counties. Challenges such as data consistency and potential voter suppression were noted as limitations, pointing to areas for further research. 

Our findings confirm the importance of demographic factors in voter turnout and emphasize the need for future studies to incorporate more recent data and qualitative research to fully grasp the evolving nature of American elections. Understanding these trends is crucial for fostering an equitable and representative democratic process.

In conclusion, while the 2020 elections showcased a vibrant democratic engagement, they also underscored the need for continued efforts to ensure that every eligible voter can participate freely and fairly in the electoral process.
